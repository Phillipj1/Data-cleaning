# Data-cleaning
For this project was based on cleaning Data. Where you replace, modify, or delete unwanted data to transform it into "clean" desired data.

the problem was too.
Write a program that:
removes all the duplicates from the data_combined.csv file. 
combine the first_name and last_name column into just one column called full_name
replace all 10s in the ratings column with 0s. 
create a column named vowel. If the person's full_name begins with a vowel, set the column to True and if it does not, set to false.

Output this file to a .csv file called clean_data.csv
